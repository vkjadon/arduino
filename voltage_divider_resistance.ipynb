        "# Choosing a Voltage Divider Resistor for a Light Dependent Resistor\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine that you are planning to use a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) for your new IoT prototype in order to detect whether or not a lamp is turned on in a (otherwise dark) room. A common way to solve this problem is the usage of a voltage divider circuit in the following form:\n",
        "\n",
        "In the above diagram, the LDR is denoted as R∗\n",
        " and R\n",
        " is another resistance required to divide the compliance voltage U0\n",
        ". Dependent on the light that falls onto the LDR, the resistance of R∗\n",
        " changes, as well as the voltage U\n",
        ". The voltage U\n",
        " can be converted into a discrete value using a Analog-to-Digital-Converter (ADC) and the retrieved value can then be evaluated in a micro-controller (μC) program in order to determine the current lighting conditions in the room. In the above diagram, U\n",
        " would be large (close to U0\n",
        "), if the light is very bright. If there is no light falling onto the LDR (in a dark room) the voltage U\n",
        " would tend towards small values. In case you want to achieve the exact opposite behaviour (small value of U\n",
        " for bright light), then you can simply swap the resistor R\n",
        " with the LDR. This is illustrated in the figure below:\n",

        "However, there is one major problem when using a voltage divider: Typically, one would like U\n",
        " to cover a wide range of values, ideally between 0V and U0\n",
        " (U∈[0V,U0]\n",
        "), independently of the range of R∗\n",
        ". This is for example important when ADCs are used, since an ADC only has a limited resolution. If U\n",
        " only changes in a small range for different lighting conditions then we do not have a sufficient signal-to-noise-ratio and it will become very difficult to distinguish bright from dark. Let us assume for example, that in our configuration (first diagram, with U0\n",
        " = 5V) the voltage U\n",
        " varies between 3.5V (very dark) and 4.5V (very bright). If we are now using a 8-Bit ADC (assuming that the reference voltage of the ADC is also U0\n",
        "), we have a voltage resolution of 5V/256\n",
        " which is approx. 0.02V\n",
        ". But since the input voltage only moves around in the interval [3.5V,4.5V]\n",
        ", the ADC will only generate an interval of about 1V/0.02V=50\n",
        " distinguishable values, although 256 would be theoretically possible. Taking slightly changing lighting conditions and other noise sources into account, this interval containing 50 discrete values is rather small and will most likely lead to false assertions about the state of the lamp (on/off) in the room. Even if we would use high resolutional ADCs in this configuration we will run into problems if we have a significant amount of noise in U\n",
        ". Hence, we should ensure that the interval of values that U\n",
        " covers is as large as possible in order to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio.\n",
        " The good news is: We can actually maximize the range of U\n",
        " by selecting R\n",
        " appropriately, if we know our extreme values (e.g., for dark and bright) of R∗\n",
        ". The bad news is: If the ratio between these extreme values – which are given by the physical constraints of the LDR (or some other component) and its environment and which cannot be chosen by us – is too small, then we again run into the problem that U\n",
        " will only cover a small interval. For this reason you should make sure that the varying resistor (LDR, force sensitive resistor, etc.) that you use has a high ratio between the extreme values for those conditions which you want to distinguish."

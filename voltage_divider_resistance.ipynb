        "A potential divider circuit, also known as a voltage divider circuit, is an electronic circuit consisting of two or more resistors connected in series, used to divide a voltage into smaller values. The circuit is designed such that the output voltage across one of the resistors is proportional to the input voltage, according to the ratio of the resistance values.\n",

        "The most common application of a potential divider circuit is to provide a variable voltage output that is proportional to a variable input voltage, for example, in volume controls, dimmer switches, and temperature sensors. By adjusting the resistance values, the output voltage can be made to vary over a specific range, depending on the input voltage.\n",

        "Imagine that you are planning to use a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) for your new IoT prototype in order to detect whether or not a lamp is turned on in a (otherwise dark) room. A common way to solve this problem is the usage of a voltage divider circuit in the following form:\n",

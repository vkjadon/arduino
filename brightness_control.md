# Controlling Brightness Using Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)

The Light Dependent Resister (LDR) is used to detect the intensity of light. This is because its resistance decreases with an increase in the light falling on it. So if we can measure the resistance of the LDR, we can estimate the intensity of the light. The is resitance is measured by measuring the potential drop across the LDR.   
We will use potential divider circuit to measure the drop across the LDR.clear

        "way that set Speed Works is it goes from zero to 255 to run the motor in a\n",
        "forward Direction and then from zero down to negative 255 to run it in\n",

        "running at a half and full speed forward stopping it and then running it at half and full speed backwards so you can see\n",
        "that it by doing this you could write some code that would work with literally any type of motor driver and all you\n",
        "would have to do is change this string up over here this line of code to\n",
        "accommodate your other motor driver and you could write the code to work with any of them and this also makes a work\n",

        "always use a map command to change one to the other so it's a pretty versatile little Library let's load it on to the\n",
        "Arduino and check it out with this motor driver and here's our final test setup for the\n",
        "day with the md25hv and for this I've got a very powerful motor I'll turn it around so\n",
        "that you can see the specs on this thing it's uh 24 volts DC with a rated current\n",
        "at 14 amperes so this is quite the Beast now I'm not actually powering it with 24\n",

        "giving out about 12.5 right now because it's fully charged and that seems to power the motor just fine it'll work for\n",

        "Arduino and so all I need to do is give the Arduino a little bit of electricity\n",
        "um and this motor is so powerful it jumps around\n",
        "now one thing that's probably a little difficult for you to see on the video is that down over here there are a couple\n",

        "all without anything on the motor driver slash controller they've got these two\n",
        "buttons here in their test buttons and you can use them to spin the motor in One Direction or the other direction so\n",
        "when you've wired everything up you can use that and that'll test your motor wiring that'll test your power supply\n",
        "wiring Etc and then of course as I've mentioned few times now this is also a\n",
        "controller and so it comes with both a switch and a potentiometer and you can\n",

        "can control the speed of the motor mmm\n",
        "and if I want I can flip the direction and do it in reverse and so if all that you need is a motor\n",

        "this whole thing might be all that's required for you you might not even need a microcontroller but otherwise this is\n",
        "a very versatile driver slash controller and as you can see it can handle pretty\n",

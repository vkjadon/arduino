        "Reversing a DC motor is simply a matter of reversing the polarity of the voltage applied to it. The most common method of doing this is to use a design called an “H-Bridge”.\n",
        "\n",
        "The operation of an H-Bridge can be illustrated using four switches arranged in this configuration resembling the shape \"H\". When all the switches are open, then the motor will receive no voltage and will remain stationary.\n",

This drop is usually 0.7 volts for a bipolar power transistor.  Since we are using TWO switches simultaneously, the total drop is about 1.4 volts.\n",

        "Newer designs use MOSFETs for improved performance. The voltage drop across a MOSFET is generally of the order of 0.1 volts or less, so this is a much more efficient design. In addition, MOSFET designs can often be made smaller, and many donot require a heatsink."

        "Reversing a DC motor is simply a matter of reversing the polarity of the voltage applied to it. The most common method of doing this is to use a design called an “H-Bridge”.\n",
        "\n",
        "The operation of an H-Bridge can be illustrated using four switches arranged in this configuration resembling the shape \"H\". When all the switches are open, then the motor will receive no voltage and will remain stationary.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "In the real world, we use bipolar transistors for this switching of the H-bridge. Bipolar transistors have a voltage drop between the emitter and collector when they are switched on. This drop is usually 0.7 volts for a bipolar power transistor.  Since we are using TWO switches simultaneously, the total drop is about 1.4 volts.\n",
        "\n",
        "This means that if you apply approximately 5.2 volts to the H-Bridge, the motor will actually receive aprroximately 3.8 volts. The energy lost is converted into heat and that is why bipolar we require heatsinks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Newer designs use MOSFETs for improved performance. The voltage drop across a MOSFET is generally of the order of 0.1 volts or less, so this is a much more efficient design. In addition, MOSFET designs can often be made smaller, and many donot require a heatsink."

Its continuous current is also less than the l298n 1.2 amperes but it has a peak current of 3.2 amperes which is close to the L298n and these specifications allow it to control a lot of those hobbyist Motors that we commonly use in L298n4.\n",
